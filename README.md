# E2E TFLite Tutorials

Here is a list of sample app ideas and projects.

We would love your help! You can help by creating a tflite model ready for implementation, add a mobile app idea that needs a tflite model created, or write an end-to-end tutorial with sample code. 

This is also where you can seek help from the community.


## Project ideas (help needed!)
If you are interested in helping out, please assign an issue from the "help needed" projects. 

* YOLO - [overview](overviews/yolo.md).
* Classify pose - [overview](overviews/classify_pose.md).
* Sound classification - [overview](overviews/classify_sound.md).
* SPICE (Pitch Detection) - [overview](overviews/spice_pitch_detection.md).
* Speech Command - [overview](overviews/speech_command.md).

## End-to-end tutorials (in progress)
Take a look at the in progress projects to see what it's like to work on a project.

* [Deeplab V3](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab ) - image segmentation, which is supported by TFLite but thereâ€™s no tutorial on how to convert Deeplab v3 TF models to TFLite.
* [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN ) object detection, which is one of the most popular on-device ML use cases.
* [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) - a very popular ASR framework.
* Segmentation + Style Transfer - [project repo](https://github.com/margaretmz/segmentation-style-transfer).

## End-to-end tutorials (completed)

Once a project has been completed, please open a PR to [awesome-tfite](https://github.com/margaretmz/awesome-tflite) to add the links of the tflite model, sample code and tutorials.
* [U-GAT-IT](https://github.com/taki0112/UGATIT) (Selfie <-> Anime) - [project repo](https://github.com/margaretmz/selfie2anime-e2e-tutorial).
